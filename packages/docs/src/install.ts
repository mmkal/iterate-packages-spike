// pins its build (`docsModule`), so the processors run the build the project chose, and a commit to
// the pin upgrades every doc on its next call. The Docs app then calls `ensureDoc` from the browser
// as a doc opens; `installDocs` is how a project without it gets it. Nothing here is the runtime.
