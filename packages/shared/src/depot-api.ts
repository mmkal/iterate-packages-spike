 * One call to Depot's CI API, the Connect JSON protocol the Depot CLI itself speaks. The methods and
 * their fields are in https://github.com/depot/cli/blob/main/proto/depot/ci/v1/ci.proto (JSON uses
 * the camelCase field names). `token` is an organization API token (`DEPOT_CI_TELEMETRY_TOKEN`).
 *
 * A read (`Get…`, `List…`) that Depot answers with a 5xx or a 429, or whose connection fails, is
 * asked again on CI_HTTP's schedule, with a `depot.platform-failure-retry` warn per repeat
 * (`fetchRetryingPlatformFailures`). Any other 4xx is an answer about the request and fails at once
 * as an HttpAnswerError with its status, as does any other method (Connect sends every call as a
 * POST, so only the name says it changes nothing). A single 500 on GetJobAttemptLogs is enough to
 * fail a trace job without the repeat.
