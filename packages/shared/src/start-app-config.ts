// start-app-config.ts — THE CONFIGURATION OF AN APP ON TOP of the platform: dash, agents, notes,
// docs, admin and voice, TanStack Start apps that are each an OAuth client of core/os and nothing
// else — but notes and docs, which a project's config worker serves under its hosts, on the host's sign-in. The platform's mechanism (app-config.ts): one `APP_CONFIG` object, and any key set alone
// as an `APP_CONFIG_*` var merged on top.
//
//   { urls: { os, dash, agents, notes, docs, admin, voice }, denyZones, posthogProjectKey, pkgPrNewRef }
//
// scripts/lib/start-app.ts writes it from envs.ts as the Worker's one `APP_CONFIG` var
// (`startAppWorkerConfig`), and a per-PR preview swaps in the same PR's origins
// (`startAppPreviewConfig`). The apps hold no secrets, so nothing comes from Doppler. Local dev
// starts from prd's and names a local platform, or a local app, in the app's gitignored
// `.dev.vars`:
//
//   APP_CONFIG_URLS__OS=http://localhost:8788
//   APP_CONFIG_URLS__VOICE=http://localhost:5174
