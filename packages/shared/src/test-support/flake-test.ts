/**
 * Known-flaky tests: the body asserts real behavior, passes are welcome, and
 * exactly one error pattern is tolerated as "the flake". Anything else is a
 * real failure.
 *
 * The sibling of `createFailing` (./failing-test.ts) — same registration trick,
 * different contract. `createFlake` registers through the runner's own
 * expected-fail variant (vitest `test.fails`, playwright `test.fail`) and
 * inverts outcomes so that:
 *
 * - body fails matching the pattern → rethrown → GREEN (the flake struck; recorded)
 * - body passes → the wrapper throws "Flaky test passed this run" → GREEN (recorded)
 * - body fails with anything else → logged, returned as success, which the
 *   expected-fail machinery rejects → RED (a real failure, not the known flake)
 * - body still running at the wrapper's deadline → RED for the same reason
 *   (without this, a runner-level timeout would satisfy the expected-fail
 *   machinery and a hang would vanish into a vacuous green)
 *
 * ```ts
 * const flake = createFlake(test, /CPU startup time exceeded \d+ms/);
 * flake("Worker can be deployed", async () => {
 *   const deployment = await system.deploy();
 *   await expect.poll(() => fetch(deployment.url)).toMatchObject({ status: 200 });
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * A flake test therefore never blocks unrelated work, but it keeps running and
 * keeps producing data. When `FLAKE_RECORD_DIR` is set, every execution
 * appends one JSON line (see FlakeRecord in ./flake-record.ts) to a per-process file in
 * that directory; CI keeps those lines for the flake dashboard. Local runs
 * without the variable record nothing.
 *
 * Lifecycle (see docs/testing.md): a test that seems flaky moves from a plain
 * test to `createFlake`; if it stops passing entirely, switch to `createFailing`;
 * once it passes consistently, unwrap it back to a plain test. Wrapping is a
 * human/agent diagnosis; the unwrap and switch-to-`createFailing` directions are
 * proposed automatically from the recorded data.
 *
 * There is no retry and no repetition: one body execution per run, one
 * recorded sample. Retry-until-pass would bias the flake rate — the one
 * number this exists to measure. On vitest this needs an explicit per-test
 * `retry: 0`: a suite-level `retry` re-runs the body on the wrapper's thrown
 * green outcomes (the retry fires before the `.fails` inversion is applied),
 * which recorded every green run twice in the preview e2e suite.
