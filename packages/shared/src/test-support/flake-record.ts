/**
 * The wire format of test-health telemetry: one JSON line per observed
 * outcome, appended to `$FLAKE_RECORD_DIR`, kept by CI in each test run's
 * evidence folder in R2, and read from there by the flake dashboard
 * (docs/testing.md#flakes-and-pinned-failures).
 *
 * Three producers write records:
 * - `createFlake` (./flake-test.ts): kind "flake" — pass / flake-fail /
 *   unexpected-error. The deliberate canary tests are just createFlake tests
 *   whose names contain "flake sentinel"; the dashboard groups them by name.
 * - `createFailing` (./failing-test.ts): kind "failing" — pinned-fail (the
 *   pin held) / unexpected-pass (the bug looks fixed) / unexpected-error.
 * - The telemetry reporters (vitest's RetryTelemetryReporter, the
 *   Playwright telemetry reporter): kind "unknown" for a PLAIN test —
 *   retried-pass when it failed and then passed on retry, unexpected-error
 *   when it failed every attempt — carrying the first failed attempt's error
 *   text. That record is the adoption funnel: the dashboard shows the error
 *   samples a person or agent turns into a createFlake pattern, and a CI
 *   retry can no longer be the only place a failure was ever written down.
