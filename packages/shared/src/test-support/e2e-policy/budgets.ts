/**
 * The e2e retry policy and timeout ladder, in one place.
 *
 * The policy (evidence and rationale: docs/testing.md#retries-and-timeouts):
 *
 * 1. Retries live in exactly ONE layer: the individual test — the smallest
 *    unit that owns its state (every test provisions its own project). One
 *    retry in CI, zero locally.
 * 2. Everything above a test is a watchdog: it fails, it never retries.
 *    Re-running is the outer edge's job (Depot re-run / next push).
 * 3. Watchdogs are sized to ~2x the healthy p99 of what they bound — never
 *    to accommodate worst-case retry stacks. A run burning retries against a
 *    wedged platform SHOULD get killed.
 * 4. Waits are progress-based (spinner-waiter); static budgets are backstops.
 * 5. Retries are measured, never silent (RetryTelemetryReporter, beside this file).
 */

/**
 * Per-test retries in CI, everywhere (vitest `retry`, playwright `retries`).
 * One, not two: across the 50-green-run marathon audit (~5,800 test
 * executions) no test ever needed a second retry, and a platform-incident
 * burst that defeats a single retry should fail the run — weather we want to
 * see, not absorb. Zero locally so a flaky test stays loud at your desk.

 * rollout propagation / a brief edge wobble). 5s is longer than every blip
