/**
 * Pinned-bug tests: the body asserts the DESIRED behavior, and while the bug
 * exists it must fail with an error matching the given pattern.
 *
 * `createFailing` registers the test through the runner's own expected-fail variant
 * — vitest spells it `test.fails`, playwright `test.fail` — so the pin is
 * native as far as reporting goes: it shows up in the "expected fail" summary
 * count, telemetry classifies it as expected-to-fail, and nothing downstream
 * needs to know the wrapper exists. The wrapper's only job is filtering WHICH
 * failure is allowed to satisfy that machinery.
 *
 * To use it, write a *normal* test body, and use a regex that you know the test (unfortunately) will fail with.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const fail = createFailing(test, /SAME-BOOT STALENESS/, { timeoutMs: 240_000 });
 * fail("a userspace facet rebuilds on a source commit", async () => {
 *   // asserts the DESIRED behavior; today it throws the matched error
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Try to write normal-looking assertions - `expect` lets you pass in a custom message if you want to
 * tip the scales for a single assertion. Use "should" so you can write a truthful statement that remains
 * true even when the test *stops* failing (the system really should not run out of memory!).
 *
 * Three outcomes:
 * - body fails matching the pattern → the error is rethrown, the runner's
 *   expected-fail machinery is satisfied → green (the bug is still pinned)
 * - body fails with anything else → the wrapper logs the mismatch and returns
 *   SUCCESS, which the expected-fail machinery rejects → red. The runner's own
 *   message is generic ("Expect test to fail" / "passed unexpectedly"); the
 *   actual reason sits in the adjacent `[failing-test]` log line. A bare
 *   `test.fails` would have stayed silently green here — that is the whole
 *   point of the wrapper.
 * - body succeeds → same mechanism: logged, returned, red — with instructions
 *   to delete the wrapper, since the bug appears fixed.
 *
 * The native machinery has one blind spot: a failure that never passes
 * through the body — chiefly a runner-level test timeout on a hung body —
 * counts as the expected one. The wrapper therefore races the body against
 * its own 30s deadline and reports a timeout as NOT-the-pinned-failure (red),
 * so a hang cannot vanish into a vacuous pass. The wrapper sets the runner's
 * own test timeout to that deadline plus a second (vitest through the
 * `timeout` option, playwright through `test.setTimeout`), so the runner never
 * fires first and the blind spot stays closed. A pin whose body legitimately
 * needs longer raises `options.timeoutMs`.
 *
 * Write the body so the pinned bug produces a DISTINCTIVE error (throw a
 * purpose-built message rather than relying on a generic assertion diff), and
 * so that conditions which prove nothing — e.g. a coincidental restart that
 * masks the bug for one observation — retry or fail with a NON-matching
 * error instead of succeeding.
 *
 * A failure that proves nothing is retried HERE, not by the runner: vitest's
 * `retry` re-runs a body that THREW (for a pin, the pinned failure — the good
 * outcome) and stops once the body passed, inverting for `.fails` only
 * afterwards — so the outcome that proves nothing is the one it never retries
 * (which is also why registration pins `retry: 0`). A pin opts in with
 * `options.retries` (an e2e pin passes `process.env.CI ? E2E_CI_RETRIES : 0`:
 * the CI retry count every plain e2e test gets, zero at a desk): a non-matching failure
 * re-runs the body that many times, after the e2e suites' CI retry pause
 * (`E2E_CI_RETRY_DELAY_MS`), with what is left of `timeoutMs` — never sleeping
 * past the deadline, so the runner's timeout cannot fire during the pause and
 * count as the pin holding. Each attempt writes its own record. A pass and a
 * hang are never retried.
