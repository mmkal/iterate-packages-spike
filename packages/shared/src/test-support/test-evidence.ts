 * config reads these paths, and the workflows set TEST_TELEMETRY_ARTIFACT_DIR and FLAKE_RECORD_DIR to
 * them (scripts/ci/depot-workflows.test.ts holds them equal). After the runners,
 * `scripts/ci/test-evidence.ts write` adds the manifest, which lists every other file with its
 * sha256; `upload` puts the folder in R2 as it is.
 *
 * Paths are relative to the repository root and are the ones the producers already used, so no
