/**
 * Every client's `<HeadContent />`, with the deployment named in the browser tab: off production,
 * the title is prefixed (`[pr2990] Dash`, `[dev] Dash`) and the icon badged
 * (iterate/lib); in production both are the app's own. `productionIcon` is the
 * app's icon file in production.
 *
 * TanStack's own HeadContent, re-assembled from its public parts (`useTags`, `Asset`; react-router
 * 1.168 src/HeadContent.tsx) so the title can be rewritten: the deepest route that names a title
 * wins (router-core `buildTagsFromMatches`), so a prefix in the root route's `head()` would vanish
 * on every page that names itself.
 *
 * `router.origin` is the request's origin in the server render (start-server-core
 * `createStartHandler` updates the router with `getOrigin(request)`) and `window.origin` in the
 * browser, so the server's HTML and the hydrated head agree.
