/**
 * The Preview half of the repo IDE's Code/Preview toggle for html files
 * (and .svg, whose raw markup an html document renders inline): renders the
 * current buffer (unsaved working-tree edits included) in a sandboxed iframe.
 *
 * Sandbox stance: `allow-scripts` and NOTHING else — crucially no
 * `allow-same-origin`, so the document runs in an opaque origin and its
 * scripts cannot reach the dashboard's cookies, storage, or DOM. Top
 * navigation, popups, forms, and modals stay denied, and no-referrer keeps
 * subresource requests from learning the dashboard URL.
 *
 * Why scripts at all: interactive previews are half the point of an html
 * renderer. Repos are project-scoped, so the author isn't necessarily the
 * viewer — a collaborator's (or agent's) committed HTML runs in YOUR browser
 * when you click Preview. The opaque origin contains that, and the accepted
 * residual risk is the one every script-enabled HTML preview accepts (VS Code
 * live preview, htmlpreview.github.io): the frame can render a convincing
 * fake UI and fetch() out whatever the viewer types into it. no-referrer
 * doesn't mitigate that — the author already knows where the file lives.
 *
 * srcdoc, not a blob URL: the Chrome quirk that forced the PDF renderer onto
 * blob URLs is specific to the PDF viewer. srcdoc carries the live buffer
 * with no object-URL lifecycle to manage.
