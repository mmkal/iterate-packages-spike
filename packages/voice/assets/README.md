`src/screen-font.ts` is `pixel-font.css` with this font embedded, and the installer stores it at
`voice/screen-font.css` in project KV. A rendering script inserts
the CSS into its HTML; Chromium needs no external font request. The model never
needs to generate or read the font's base64 bytes. The CSS family name is
`Iterate Pixel`; use normal weight at 16px or 24px with integer positions.
